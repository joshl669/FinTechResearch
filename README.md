### **Overview and Origin**

Stripe - "How two brothers turned 7 lines of Code into a Multi-Billion Startup"

*Stripe* is a global payments processor that creates infrastructure for online financial transactions. What that means is: Stripe enables anyone to accept and make payments online. It was *founded in 2009* by Irish twins John and Patrick Collison.

>Processing the world’s payments is a lucrative business, and one that benefits from the joint tailwinds of the growth of ecommerce and the growth of card networks like Visa and Mastercard. As long as more companies look to accept payment for services in some digital form, whether online or by phone, Stripe is well-positioned to be the intermediary.

Other business lines include Stripe Capital (lends to companies directly based on their cash flow) and Stripe Atlas. Stripe Atlas helps you launch your internet company from anywhere while reducing the lengthy paperwork, legal challenges, etc…

___

*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*

- Pay as you go pricing and uniform fee rate


- Partnership with Amazon – Stripe handles an undisclosed amount of transactions for the company.

- Network structure and technology - Stripe's interface is seamless and easily highlights bank transfers and HTTP request logs.

API, security, and customer service has changed the technology of the industry.

Their infrastructure platform is so efficient that its gaining market share from top clients such as Target and Shopify.

*Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*

Stripe uses Plaid Link (Plaid) to offer frictionless money transfers without the need to ever handle an account or routing number. Plaids Link API is a tool for authenticating bank account information when dealing with online payments. Instead of dealing with sensitive information like routing numbers they use tokens.

*What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*

Stripe operates in the Payments Domain of FinTech

*What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*

> The evolution of the e-businesses and the way money is transferred have given way to new companies and industries. Money has evolved from being transferred via cash or check to electronic alternatives. 

> A payment gateway is an e-commerce application service provider that authorizes credit card payments for businesses. Early players include PayPal and World Pay then Amazon payments and Klarna.

> Those companies lacked innovation to improve customer experience in the point of sale transaction.

> Other companies such as Braintree and Stripe came along and made strides of improvement on the technology.

> Stripe with user-friendly API, security and customer service has changed the course of technology. Stripe’s software kits support Apple Pay integration in iOS apps, Bitcons and Alipay.

 *What are the other major companies in this domain?*

- Apple 
- Amazon 
- Paypal 
- Worldpay 
- Bulge Bracket Banks 
- Google
- Alibaba
- Klarna
- Adyen


*What has been the business impact of this company so far?*

- $36B valuation
 
 - Significant increases in volume, however, margins are becoming smaller as bigger players take higher volumes 

- Companies that joined Stripe in March of 2020 have already generated $1B in revenue

*What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?*

- Volume and/or value of transactions

- taking a strategic view of payments and “payment-proximate” activities, to devise and offer value-added solutions and products, 
 - identifying markets and lines of business where payments are a prominent aspect, 
- updating their technology to deliver services and solutions in line with customer expectations, as opposed to internal operational silos, 
- actively targeting payment flows related to demographics, such as the compensation and pension flows linked to the baby boomer generation, or the emerging middle classes in China and Indonesia, - - targeting high-growth and traditionally poorly served customer segments such as small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), 
- exploring non-traditional alliances and partnership models, including strategic cross-sectoral partnerships with those they might not have considered previously (such as mobile or social network operators), to enable access to new client bases. 


*How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*

Stripe has managed to capture 3% of the market and revenues are somewhere around $3.4B

Stripe has built a reputation for its technology and API

*How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*
It is competitive and maintaining itself as a key player behind Paypal and other large Banks and FinTech companies.

*Key Risks/Threats to the business/industry and evolution or future of the industry*

> The biggest unknown for Stripe’s prospects is whether open-source payment processing technology gets developed in a way that puts price pressure on Stripe’s margins. Proponents of crypto as a medium of exchange predict that decentralized currencies could have such low costs that vendors are incentivized to switch to them to save on the fees of payment networks. However, in such an event Stripe could easily be a mercenary, and convert its processing business into a free product that underpins many other more lucrative services layered on-top (similar to the free trading transition brought about by Robinhood).

## Recommendations
---

*If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*

I would advise on partnering with a company like digit that offers customers solutions to saving and paying off debts. 

From the analysis of the transactions they could provide recommendations on credit card types based on the users spending – this also could be a way to engage to the consumer level.

*Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*

The volume that Stripe has could generate more revenue by utilizing a business model such as Digits. It  would be a pathway into another market, asset management. If they are key players in transactions then the next step would be into asset management and using code or technology to provide strategies to manage capital more efficiently. 

*What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*

APIs and being able to connect with Banks, Investment Advisors or Wealth Management, Credit Card Companies, and financial services.

*Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
The data infrastructure they use to connect the different networks.
